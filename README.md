## Inspiration
This project is based/inspired from [AmazonAutoBuyBot GitHub project](https://github.com/davildf/Amazonautobuybot).
I used it to monitor a couple of objects, but it was too basic for my needs.
So I started a brand new project but re-using the login code to avoid to spend time on it, even if now it supports 2FA as well as it stores cookies to avoid login all times the app starts.
A part the login fill-and-submit code, the code was totally rewritten.
